ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @R3ALITI3S!

- I have a passion for 2D/3D artwork, videography, AR/VR, and illustrations, alongside an interest in coding.

- Currently, I'm honing my coding skills as a Medialogy student at Aalborg University.

- Iâ€™m eager to collaborate on GAME development and ARTWORK! While my forte lies in art, I'm keen to contribute to coding tasks as well.

- Pronouns: She/Her

- Fun fact: In addition to my creative pursuits, I'm also involved in theater!

Looking forward to forging meaningful collaborations.
